# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project

Tech Radar — a personal radar for tools and services, kept as a single Markdown file (`radar.md`).

## File structure

- `radar.md` — the radar content (main file)
- `README.md` — repo description, links to the radar

## Conventions

- **Scope**: Tools & services only (no practices or techniques)
- **Statuses**: Adopt / Trial / Assess / Hold
- **Categories**: Top-level `##` headings (e.g. Languages, Frameworks, Databases, Cloud, DevOps). Add or remove freely.
- **Entries**: `### Name — Status` followed by a short paragraph explaining the reasoning.

## Workflow

Always check with the user before making changes.

## Git

Do not include the `Co-Authored-By` trailer in commit messages.
