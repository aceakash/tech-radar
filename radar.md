# Tech Radar

A personal tech radar for tools and services, inspired by [ThoughtWorks' Tech Radar](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar).

## Statuses

- **Adopt** — Safe to use. My default choice for this problem space.
- **Trial** — Worth pursuing. Trying it out on side projects or actively building up this capability.
- **Assess** — Worth exploring. On my radar but haven't got around to trying it yet.
- **Hold** — Proceed with caution. Reached for in the past but wouldn't choose again, or evaluated and rejected.

## Terminal

### [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org/) — Adopt

Fast and simple.

### [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) — Adopt

Used for 10 years before moving to Ghostty. Still a solid choice, you can't go wrong with it.

## Shell

### [Fish](https://fishshell.com/) — Adopt

Autosuggestions from history as you type, syntax highlighting in the terminal and great tab completions, all out of the box. Not POSIX-compatible, so you need to drop into bash for scripts that require it.

## CLI Tools

### [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) — Adopt

A `cat` replacement with syntax highlighting, line numbers and git integration out of the box.

## Knowledge Management

### [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) — Adopt

Local-first, Markdown-based and highly extensible with plugins. Your notes are just files on disk, no vendor lock-in.

### [Notion](https://www.notion.com/) — Hold

Feature-rich but proprietary. Content is locked in their platform. Moved to Obsidian for the local-first, Markdown-based approach.

## AI Tools

### [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) — Adopt

AI-powered coding assistant that runs in the terminal. Useful for exploring codebases, writing code and automating multi-step tasks.

## Email

### [Proton Mail](https://proton.me/mail) — Adopt

Privacy by default.

### [Gmail](https://mail.google.com/) — Hold

Getting locked out of Gmail would be disastrous and Google support is abysmal.

## Browser

### [Brave](https://brave.com/) — Adopt

Chromium-based so all Chrome extensions work. Good built-in ad blocker, search and AI summaries. The crypto features are annoying but easy to switch off. Using as both desktop and mobile browser.

## Infrastructure

### [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/) — Adopt

Cheap and simple DNS management.

### [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) — Adopt

Reliable VPS hosting with great UX and superb documentation.

### [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/) — Trial

Excellent pricing for VPS. Trying it out for side projects.
