# Tech Radar

A personal tech radar for tools and services, inspired by [ThoughtWorks' Tech Radar](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar).

## Statuses

- **Adopt** — Safe to use. My default choice for this problem space.
- **Trial** — Worth pursuing. Trying it out on side projects or actively building up this capability.
- **Assess** — Worth exploring. On my radar but haven't got around to trying it yet.
- **Hold** — Proceed with caution. Reached for in the past but wouldn't choose again, or evaluated and rejected.
